### Project Title
**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
The program provides the statistics of a bicycle-sharing system for three various cities; `Chicago`, `Washington` and `New York City`. The user makes a choice of city to explore and this is filtered by specific months and the days of the week(_if user input is wrong, it rejects input_). It outputs the statistics and afterwards asks the user if he/she will like to view the raw table of the data,if positive it outputs the table in 5 rows per display. Then, when the user is done with the view(_having no more rows to display_) or stops the display(_by inputing the negative_), the program asks to know if the user wants to restart the explore or end it there(_if positive, the program starts over again but if negative it ends the program_).
